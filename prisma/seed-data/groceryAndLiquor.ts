      "Yes, most call it Astor Wines. Yes, it has a massive selection of wine. Yes, it’s a great place to buy wine. But really, Astor Wines is the best liquor store in NYC. Period. It’s where I go to buy amaro, mezcal, rare whiskey, handles of gin for negroni parties, niche vermouths for recipe development, and just about anything else boozy you can imagine. Sign up for their newsletter for awesome deals, and when you’re done grabbing amaro, ALWAYS hit the refrigerated wine cellar to see what’s popping, old or new.",

      "If it’s from Spain and it tastes good, it’s probably at Despaña. SoHo is a big-time grocery desert, but you can snag tinned fish, sliced ham, sausages, pickled peppers, cheeses, oil, vinegar, paella rice, spices, and just about anything else you would find in a well-stocked, cool-kid Spanish pantry at this shop. They also serve prepared foods and have a wine shop attached to the grocery, with some excellent Spanish wines from producers like Envinate. If you’re like, why the fuck haven’t I seen this place? It’s probably because it's been covered in scaffolding for years.",

Lots of California producers like Arnot Roberts and Methode Sauvage, French and Italian classics like Fred Cossard and Alessandro Viola, and even some newer NYS stuff from Floral Terranes. They also deliver in the neighborhood.",

If you’re in the area looking for miso, noodles, pickles, Kewpie mayo, shrimp chips, nori sheets, or just about any other Japanese snack or pantry item, this is a good stop to make. They also sell some prepared katsu bowls and salads for the lunch crowd, if you happen to be on the hunt. Don’t forget a yuzu soda for the road. (You’re welcome.)",

The selection is small, but the range in price is excellent, and you can snag some top-tier Jura whites as well as some Alpine reds, ranging from super structured to light and loose. The liquor selection is also on the smaller side but filled with quality bottles worthy of a ticket to that party you're headed to or a more permanent spot on your bar.",

And those people all swear by The Alchemist’s Kitchen, which sells a ton of herbal supplements, medicinal mushrooms (sadly not those kind), magic powders, and tinctures. The selection is quite large, and there are a bunch of holistic health brands you’ll recognize. You can also just grab a kombucha or a water if you’re thirsty and walking by.

You can find dried chilis, herbs, bivalves, fish, fruits, vegetables, seeds, and mushrooms, along with sauces, condiments, noodles, and just about anything else you could possibly stock in a pantry on the PWH shelves. The shop is obviously good for home cooks of all kinds, but if you’re a broth or soup obsessive, and you haven’t been to PWH…I don’t know…you might be a bit of a poser. Save your reputation in the soup community. Get there ASAP.",

Or wine from up-and-coming American producers. Or wine from highly sought-after French producers. Or just about any wine that is cool and tasty and as good to bring to a dinner party filled with wine professionals as it is to drink by yourself in your apartment. Wine Therapy is your shop. It’s number one on my list of wine shops in NYC, for recommended visits and for personal visits. It really can’t be beat.",

It’s an institution that draws tourists and locals alike, so if you’re there when everyone else is, it's best to take a number, put your headphones in, and mind your business. Skip the Italian pantry goods (overpriced IMO) and focus your attention on the meat and cheese counters. Sharp provolone. Prosciutto cotto. Mortadella. Fresh mozzarella. Porchetta. Maybe some frozen ravioli. Grab it all by the pound and set yourself up for a highly complimented antipasto spread at that dinner party you’re throwing this evening. (Send me the invite already. Jeez.)",

The space, filled with stalls serving cooked food and grocery items, is almost always slammed. It can get more than hectic. But keep your eyes on the prize, and you're golden. Whether the prize is fresh vegetables, butchered meats, BBQ’d meats by the pound, Chinese pantry staples, frozen dumplings, or fresh noodles, that’s your call. Grab a coffee at Cafe Integral or a steamed bun at Golden Steamer post-shopping to recharge. They’re both within a couple blocks.",

But Alleva gets kind of slept on by locals, because it’s on a corner of Mulberry that is a legitimate pit of tourist-onset misery. Push forth though, because the fresh mozzarella at Alleva is truly exceptional. As is the ricotta. And if you’re like, yeah, I got my fresh cheese, buddy, but I’m a little hungry, calm down. You can grab a sausage, peppers, and onion sandwich for immediate indulgence.",

We’re talking zero proof aperitifs, canned elixirs, booze-free wine, and 0% ABV beers. If there’s a cool-kid NA brand in this world, you’ll most likely be able to find it at Spirited Away. And if I may, the St. Agrestis Phony Negroni is an excellent place to start if you’re looking for an NA cocktail.",

The prepared foods are amazing, especially all of the tofu and soy-related products from fresh tofu to soy milk. And the youtiao (fried dough dipped in soy milk) is truly legendary. Buy fresh rice noodles for later and rip an order of youtiao for now.",

It feels intimate and romantic and like (what I imagine) a butcher shop on Elizabeth St. a century ago might feel like. Grab a steak or a chop or some ground pork to go with that Gamay you bought at Wine Therapy.",

Tortellini. Manicotti. If there’s stuff inside the pasta, it’ll be there. I like the classic ricotta/cheese versions of everything, but the artichoke, gorgonzola, mushroom, and spinach fillings are all great too. Buy a dozen. Buy fifty. Buy fifty dozen.

The best Spanish potato chips. Jarred olives, artichokes, and peppers. Vinegars. Olive oils. Rare chocolates. Packaged desserts you’ve never seen but will pretend to have known about for years when your friends ask.

It’s fun as all hell, and they’re open until midnight, in case you need a gummy fix after the bar. In the summer, their soft serve is also fantastic.",
