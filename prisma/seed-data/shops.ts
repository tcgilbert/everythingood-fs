      "Aeon is located in the lower level of a building on East Braodway, under the restaurant Kopitiam. It’s a used bookstore with a wildly diverse range of books, from rare art books to counter-culture manuals to poetry anthologies to psychology essays to uber-niche titles covering just about any subculture you can think of. They have a solid selection of obscure vinyl and a gallery space in the rear. Most of the time, I leave with something I wasn't planning on buying. And sometimes with something I never even knew existed.",

The deck lineup is always rotating, and you can get a quick grip re-up, bearing swap, or hardware setup. But if you don’t skate, it’s also worth a visit for the merch.

Emily Bode’s cuts are absolutely beautiful, and the wood-clad interior is designed by Green River Projects. It’s a great place to find an off-the-wall investment piece rooted in classic men’s garments. Or to find some styling inspiration for more affordable clothing.",

Stoffa’s main thing is made-to-order pants, shirts, and outerwear, but the brand also regularly collaborates on ceramics, eyewear, and other accessories. The clothing is simple, beautiful, and constructed expertly. These are lifetime pieces in a space built for lovers of all types of design. This is one of my favorite brands for anything, anywhere.",

The speaker selection is excellent, and the two-level store also houses a used record store and The Headphone Annex, which specializes in all types of…you guessed it…headphones.",
